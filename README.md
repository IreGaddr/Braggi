# Braggi

> *"Poetry in motion; if error your syntax, then no collapse"*

Braggi is a modern systems programming language with a revolutionary approach to memory management, error handling, and concurrency. Instead of following the traditional lexer â†’ parser â†’ AST pipeline, Braggi reframes language processing as an entropy reduction problem with syntax and grammar constraints.

## Language Philosophy

Braggi was born from the desire to create a language that's both powerful and approachable, combining:

- **Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection**: Region-based memory management with lifetime constraints
- **Expressive Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages with cultural flair
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Innovative constraint-based approach to syntax and semantics
- **Region Semantics**: First-class regions providing control over memory without manual management

## Key Features

### Region-Based Memory Management
```braggi
region GameLoop {
    entities: Vec<Entity> = Vec::new();
    
    // Memory automatically freed when region ends
    fn process() {
        let temp = region Temporary {
            // Sub-region for short-lived allocations
        }
    }
}
```

### Wave Function Collapse Constraint System
Braggi uses a Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to resolve code constructs. This innovative approach allows for:

- More natural error messages
- Gradual type resolution
- Context-aware syntax features

```braggi
// The compiler collapses possibilities as it processes code
func calculate(value) {
    // Type determined by constraints and usage
    result = value * 2
    return result // Return type propagates upward
}
```

### Entropy Reduction Programming Model
Instead of traditional parsing, Braggi collapses a field of possibilities into valid code through constraint propagation, leading to better error messages and more flexible syntax.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.10 or higher
- A C compiler supporting C11 (GCC or Clang recommended)
- Optional: libreadline-dev (for enhanced REPL experience)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Simple build script
./run_build.sh

# Or manual build
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run the REPL
./bin/braggi-repl
```

### Installing readline (recommended)

For a better REPL experience with command history and line editing:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

# On Fedora
sudo dnf install readline-devel

# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install readline
```

## Project Structure

- `include/` - Header files
- `src/` - Source code
  - `src/region.c` - Memory region management
  - `src/error.c` - Error handling with personality
