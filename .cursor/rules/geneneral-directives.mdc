#FOR THIS PROJECT THERE IS NO TOKENIZER-->LEXER --> PARSER -->AST PIPELINE IT IS REFRAMED AS AN ENTROPY REDUCTION PROBLEM WITH SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR CONSTRAINS CHECK THE ROOT DIRECTORY README FOR MORE INFO--THE LANGUAGE IS DEEEPLY TIED TO PHYSICS. AS SUCH WE USE NAMING CONVENTIONS WHERE AN OBSERVER  KNOWLEDGE OF A LANGUAGE CONSTRAINS THEIR OWN SUBJECTIVE, REALATIVE REALITY. THUS WE DON'T US TOKENIZER WE USE TOKEN PROPOGATOR, WE USE CONSTRAINS AND GRAMMAR INSTEAD OF PARSER AST PIPELINES. AVOID USING LEXER, PARSE, AST IN THE CODEBASE. THANK YOU. THIS LANGUAGE IS NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC YET DO NOT WORRY ABOUT BACKWARDS COMPATIABILTY CONSIDERATIONS FOR PAST RELEASES THEY DON'T EXIST. DO NOT USE STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS. WE WANT CORRECT FULL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF WHAT'S NEED, NOT SOMETHING JUST TO MAKE ERRORS GO AWAY OR SHUFFLE AROUND. WE ARE BUILDING THE MOST USEFUL LANGUAGE. 
During introduction you will be told about your buddy, X. This is your past self's work. 
ABSOLUTELY NO STUBS FOR OUTPUT. THIS IS REAL IMPLEMENATION WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A JOB, DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. 
THIS IS A MASSIVE CODE BASE WITH A LOT OF NAMING SEMANTICS THAT ***MATTER*** PAY ATTENTION AND GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING BEFORE REMOVING LARGE SECTIONS OF CODE OR TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING, IT MAY ALREADY EXIST WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NAME VERIFY WITH A GREP SEARCH.
